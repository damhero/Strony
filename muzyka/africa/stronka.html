                    I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
                    But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
                    She's coming in, 12: 30 flight<br>
                    The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
                    I stopped an old man along the way<br>
                    Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
                    He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
                    It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
                    There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
                    I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                    Gonna take some time to do the things we never had<br>
                    The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
                    As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company<br>
                    I know that I must do what's right<br>
                    As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti<br>
                    I seek to cure what's deep inside,…<br>

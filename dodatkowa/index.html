            <div>Some people find scuba diving as something impossible. The term "To dive" itself gives many people
                chills. They associate it with some special underwater operiations, military etc. Scuba diving is
                considered as third most dangerous sport in the world, but in fact the sea is waiting for you! The only
                thing you have to do is to immerse under the panel of woter. In that moment every worries that you had
                in mind just dissapear. Now it's only you and water.</div>
            <div>"From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders. He is bolted to earth. But man has

            <div>It's not as hard as you might think to become a scuba diver. Few lectures and pool dives and you will
                get your certification. Don't worry about safety. Your instructor will always be with you. After the
                course you will be properly train and you will be able to take care of your safety. However remember
                that scuba diving is a recreational sport so instructor always will swim around and look after you. Of
                course it will be only a beginning of yor diving adventure. After you pass your first exam you will have
                a lot of opportunities. If you continue you will gain more experience, better competence and build your
                self-confidence. Someday maybe you will become scuba diving instructor and you will be a Guardian Angel
                to those "fishes".</div>

        </div>
        <section>Let's be honest. Diving is addivtive sport. Once you take your first breath undewater you won't be able
            to stop. You'll want more, longer, deeper. The undewater world will start to fascinate you. The fishes that
            you'll see won't be enough. You'll want to explore caves, wrecks, new reefs. Before you even realize you'll
            become an experienced diver. Maybe you'll find some new hobby like underwater photography. Remember in
            underwater World every meter brings new attractions. Every diving spot has something diffrient to offer.
            First one will have beautifull reefs with a lot of tiny fishes. The other one will have dark caves with huge
            fishes. What is the most interesting is that every next dive is diffrient from the previous one and that's
            why you'll never get bored! What is more almost everyone can dive. You need to be 12 years old to start
            diving, so when you will be addicted then you can take your family and dive with them. It starts from one
            diver, then it becomes a whole generation. </section>

            You have the feeling like all your problems, worries they are all gone. What is important is you and
            underwater world. It feels like a completely new reality. You can feel this freedom, because you are all in
            water it's like you were in space. Nothing confines you and the only limit you have is your courage and

            benefits? For me it is and I think everyone need his own passion to be happy.</div>

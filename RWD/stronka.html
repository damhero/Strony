                                Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices.
                                 The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power.<br>
                                 Responsive Web pages can be visited on every device, and still be clear and visible.

                                The first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was Audi.com launched in late 2001, created by a team at razorfish consisting of JÃ¼rgen Spangl and Jim Kalbach , Ken Olling , and Jan Hoffmann. Limited browser capabilities meant that for Internet Explorer, the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for Netscape, the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized.

                        <h1>What is the diffrence?</h1>
                            <p>        
                                The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.
                                Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.
                                Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, e.g. width of the rendering surface.
                                Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone.

                            <p>        
                                A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries, an extension of the @media rule. It helps them look nicer on every device or browser.
